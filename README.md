## 🔧 Redux State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management with the following structure:

- **product-price**: Object containing product names and their prices
- **cart**: Object tracking items and their quantities in the cart
- **offers**: Object storing active offers and discounts
- **subTotal**: Calculated subtotal before discounts
- **savings**: Total savings from applied offers
- **totalAmount**: Final amount after discounts

### Redux Actions

- `addToCart`: Adds items to cart and recalculates offers
- `removeFromCart`: Removes items from cart and recalculates offers
- `updateCart`: Updates item quantity in cart

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Product Page**: Users can view all available products and add them to the cart
2. **Cart Page**: Users can view their cart, see applied offers, and adjust quantities
3. **Automatic Offers**: When items are added or removed, the Redux slice automatically:
   - Checks for eligible offers
   - Calculates discounts
   - Updates subtotal, savings, and total amount
